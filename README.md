## Overview

CricStats is a comprehensive cricket statistics platform powered by 5,164 curated matches from Cricsheet. It features ball-by-ball analysis of 2.85 million deliveries across 3,230 players, covering international cricket and major T20 leagues. Unlike mainstream cricket sites, CricStats specializes in **granular matchup analytics** — player vs player head-to-heads with format, phase, and year-by-year breakdowns — alongside traditional career statistics and team analytics.

The platform is built as a full-stack application with a PostgreSQL backend, FastAPI REST API, and modern Next.js frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

---

## Features

- **Player Profiles** — Comprehensive career statistics with year-wise batting/bowling records. IPL separated from other T20 formats for cleaner analytics.
- **Batter vs Bowler Matchups** — Head-to-head matchup cards showing format, phase (powerplay/middle/death), and year-by-year breakdowns.
- **Batting Partnerships** — Career records between any two batters with total runs, average partnership, and best partnership scores.
- **Phase Specialist Stats** — Powerplay/middle/death breakdown for T20 formats showing strike rate and consistency by phase.
- **Form Guide** — Last 10 innings displayed as a colour-coded visual strip showing runs and opposition.
- **Team Head-to-Head** — Win records, season-by-season results, and recent match history between any two teams.
- **Player Comparison** — Side-by-side career statistics comparison with shareable URL.
- **Homepage Highlights** — Rotating stat cards, "on fire right now" players, and rivalry of the day insights with 24-hour caching.

**Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with normalized schema for matches, innings, deliveries, and wickets. Ten materialized views pre-aggregate player stats, partnerships, and team matchups to achieve sub-100ms query response times.

**Ingestion Layer**: Python ETL pipeline with smart sync logic—first run downloads the full Cricsheet zip (~80MB), subsequent runs only grab the 30-day zip (~3MB). Automatically refreshes all materialized views after each sync and logs sync status.

**API Layer**: FastAPI with Pydantic models for type safety and automatic OpenAPI documentation. All SQL queries centralized in `queries.py` module.

**Frontend Layer**: Next.js 16 with App Router pattern, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS 4 for styling. Debounced player search with dropdown results and real-time form validation.

## Database Schema

### Core Tables (7)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `players` | Player metadata (name, player_id hash) |
| `competitions` | Competition names and types (T20, ODI, Test, etc.) |
| `matches` | Match metadata (date, venue, teams, result, format) |
| `innings` | Innings data (batting_team, bowling_team per match) |
| `deliveries` | Ball-by-ball records (batter, bowler, runs, phase) |
| `wickets` | Wicket details (player_out, kind, fielders) |
| `sync_log` | Ingestion history (run_at, matches_added, status) |

### Materialized Views (10)

Pre-aggregated analytics tables refreshed after each sync:

- `mv_player_batting` — Career batting stats by format (runs, avg, SR, centuries)
- `mv_player_bowling` — Career bowling stats by format (wickets, economy, avg, 5-wicket hauls)
- `mv_batter_vs_bowler` — Head-to-head matchup stats with format/phase/year breakdown
- `mv_partnerships` — Batting partnership records between any two batters
- `mv_player_vs_team` — Player performance vs specific teams
- `mv_venue_stats` — Venue-specific player statistics
- `mv_team_vs_team` — Team head-to-head records (all-time)
- `mv_team_vs_team_seasons` — Team head-to-head by season
- `mv_team_recent_matches` — Last 20 matches for trending/recent results
- `mv_stat_cards` — Pre-computed homepage stat cards (all-time records)

---

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.11 or higher
- **PostgreSQL** 14 or higher
- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- **Git**

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iam-Hemanth/cricket-stats.git
cd cricket-stats
```

#### 2. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Configure Database

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/cricketdb
```

Replace `username`, `password`, and `cricketdb` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

#### 5. Create Database Schema

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f db/schema.sql
```

This creates all 7 core tables.

#### 6. Ingest Data

```bash
python3 ingestion/ingest_all.py
```

This downloads ~80MB of data from Cricsheet. The ingest
filter automatically keeps only curated matches (major
ICC events, bilateral series involving top 8 nations,
and allowed T20 leagues). Expect ~5,164 matches ingested
out of ~17,000 total files (~30-45 minutes on first run).

#### 7. Create Materialized Views

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f db/materialized_views.sql
python3 db/create_views.py
```

The first command creates the view definitions; the second populates them from the ingested data.

#### 7a. Run API Tests

```bash
pytest -q
```

This runs the automated FastAPI regression tests in `tests/`. For a quick manual smoke test against a running server, you can also run:

```bash
python api/test_api.py
```

#### 8. Start the API Server

```bash
python3 -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. View interactive API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

#### 9. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd web
npm install
```

#### 10. Create Frontend Environment

Create `web/.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

#### 11. Start the Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 12. Open in Browser

Navigate to **http://localhost:3000**

## Data Sync

CricStats uses an automated sync pipeline to keep match data updated with new Cricsheet releases.

### Manual Sync

Run the sync command:

```bash
python3 ingestion/sync.py
```

### Smart Sync Logic

- **First run**: Downloads the full Cricsheet zip (~80MB). Filter in ingestion/match_filter.py automatically keeps only allowed matches.
- **Subsequent runs**: Downloads only the 30-day zip (~3MB) containing recent matches and corrections
- **View refresh**: Automatically refreshes all 8 materialized views after sync completes
- **Status tracking**: Every sync is logged to `sync_log` table with timestamp, matches added, and status

### Automated Sync (GitHub Actions)

A GitHub Actions workflow can be enabled to run sync automatically on a schedule:

- See `.github/workflows/sync.yml` (configured for deployment stage)
- Default: Runs every 6 hours
- Syncs directly to production Supabase database

## Key Technical Decisions

**Why Materialized Views**: The dataset contains 9.69 million deliveries. Computing career/partnership stats on-the-fly would take 2–5 seconds. Materialized views pre-aggregate at the player/team level, reducing query time to sub-100ms. Trade-off: 5–10 minutes refresh time after each sync.

**Why Smart Sync**: First ingestion takes ~5 minutes to download and parse 80MB. Cricsheet's 30-day zip contains only recent matches and corrections. By switching to the 30-day zip on subsequent syncs, we reduce routine sync from 80MB to 3MB (1-minute runtime).

**Why curated data scope**: The full Cricsheet dataset is ~1.6GB — too large for any free-tier cloud database. CricStats keeps only meaningful cricket: ICC events, bilateral series between top 8 nations (India, Australia, England, Pakistan, South Africa, New Zealand, West Indies, Sri Lanka), and major T20 leagues (IPL, SA20, The Hundred, ILT20, MLC). Tests from 2011+, ODIs from 2007+. This brings the database to 457MB — within Supabase's 500MB free tier.

**Why `format_bucket`**: Cricsheet inconsistently labels formats: international T20s are `'IT20'`, domestic T20s are `'T20'`, and IPL is `'T20'` with competition filter. CricStats normalizes this into `format_bucket` (IPL, T20, IT20, ODI, Test, etc.) for clearer analytics separation.

**Why UNION ALL in Views**: The `mv_player_batting` and `mv_player_bowling` views use `UNION ALL` to separate IPL rows from other T20 rows, allowing filtering like "Compare Kohli's IPL SR vs his other T20 SR." This provides cleaner analytics without cluttering the data model.

## Roadmap

See [POST_DEPLOYMENT_ROADMAP.md](POST_DEPLOYMENT_ROADMAP.md) for a complete feature backlog.

### Top 5 Post-Deployment Priorities

1. **Full player name display** — Add `display_name` column to display "Virat Kohli" instead of "V Kohli"
2. **Top run scorers/wicket takers in team matchups** — New endpoints for India vs Australia: who scored most, who took most wickets
3. **Phase specialist badges** — Automatic badge: "Death overs specialist" if death SR is 20+ points higher than powerplay
4. **Player comparison improvements** — Career overlap indicator, quick stat summary cards, multi-format comparison
5. **BBL data restoration** — Re-add Big Bash League data if Supabase storage allows after optimization
